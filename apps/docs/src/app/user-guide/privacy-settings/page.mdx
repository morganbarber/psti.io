# Privacy Settings

SecurePaste offers multiple privacy levels to control who can access your pastes.

## Privacy Levels

### Public

- **Visibility:** Anyone can find and view
- **Listing:** Appears in public paste listings
- **Search:** Searchable by anyone
- **Best for:** Code examples, tutorials, public sharing

**How to create:**
1. Create a new paste
2. Select **Public** from the privacy dropdown
3. Create paste

### Unlisted

- **Visibility:** Only people with the link can view
- **Listing:** Does not appear in public listings
- **Search:** Not searchable
- **Best for:** Sharing with specific people without password protection

**How to create:**
1. Create a new paste
2. Select **Unlisted** from the privacy dropdown
3. Share the unique URL with intended recipients

> **Note:** Unlisted pastes are not truly private - anyone with the URL can access them.

### Private

- **Visibility:** Only you can view (requires login)
- **Listing:** Only visible in your dashboard
- **Search:** Only searchable by you
- **Best for:** Personal notes, drafts, sensitive information

**How to create:**
1. Create a new paste (must be logged in)
2. Select **Private** from the privacy dropdown
3. Create paste

> **Important:** Private pastes require you to be logged in to view.

### Password Protected

- **Visibility:** Anyone with the link AND password can view
- **Listing:** Does not appear in public listings
- **Search:** Not searchable
- **Best for:** Sharing sensitive information with specific people

**How to create:**
1. Create a new paste
2. Select **Password Protected** from the privacy dropdown
3. Enter a strong password
4. Create paste
5. Share both the URL and password (separately for security)

**Viewing password-protected pastes:**
1. Navigate to the paste URL
2. Enter the password when prompted
3. View the paste

> **Security Tip:** Share the URL and password through different channels (e.g., URL via email, password via Signal).

## Changing Privacy Settings

To change the privacy level of an existing paste:

1. Navigate to your paste
2. Click **Edit**
3. Change the privacy level dropdown
4. Save changes

> **Note:** Making a private paste public will make it visible to everyone. This action cannot be easily undone.

- Enable encryption (see [Security Features](/user-guide/security-features))

- Use **Password Protected** for cross-team sharing
- Organize with folders for easy management

### For Public Code Examples

- Use **Public** for tutorials and examples
- Add clear titles and descriptions
- Choose appropriate syntax highlighting
